### *Project Overview: E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack)*

This project will guide you through building a full-stack e-commerce web application using the *MERN stack* (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). You will learn how to implement key functionalities such as *user authentication, **product management, and **order handling* while gaining hands-on experience with REST APIs, database schema design, and frontend development with React.

---

### *Key Features:*
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration with JWT.
- **Product Management:** CRUD operations for products, with features like filtering and sorting.
- **Order Handling:** Users can place and view orders.
- **REST API:** Build scalable API endpoints for managing users, products, and orders.
- **Frontend:** Responsive UI built with React for a smooth user experience.

---

### *Core Concepts:*
- **MERN Stack**: Using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for full-stack development.
- **REST APIs**: Design and develop API endpoints for user and product management.
- **Authentication**: Implement secure login and session management.
- **Database Schema**: Design MongoDB schemas for users, products, and orders.

---

### *Next Steps:*
1. Set up the **development environment** and install dependencies.
2. Implement a **basic server** using Node.js and Express.
3. Start building the **React frontend** and connect it to the backend.
4. Design **MongoDB schemas** for structured data storage.

This project will help you master the full-stack development process, from database to frontend, with a focus on scalability and user interaction.
